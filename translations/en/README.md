# Data Science for Beginners - A Curriculum

Azure Cloud Advocates at Microsoft are excited to present a 10-week, 20-lesson curriculum focused on Data Science. Each lesson includes pre-lesson and post-lesson quizzes, detailed instructions, solutions, and assignments. This project-based approach helps you learn effectively by building, ensuring the skills you acquire are retained.

#### Join Our Community 
[![Azure AI Discord](https://dcbadge.limes.pink/api/server/kzRShWzttr)](https://aka.ms/ds4beginners/discord)

We are hosting a Discord "Learn with AI" series from September 18–30, 2025. Join us to learn tips and tricks for using GitHub Copilot in Data Science.

![Learn with AI series](../../translated_images/1.2b28cdc6205e26fef6a21817fe5d83ae8b50fbd0a33e9fed0df05845da5b30b6.en.jpg)

# Are you a student?

Start with these resources:

- [Student Hub page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/student-hub?WT.mc_id=academic-77958-bethanycheum): Find beginner resources, student packs, and even ways to get a free certification voucher. Bookmark this page and check back often as content is updated monthly.
- [Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors](https://studentambassadors.microsoft.com?WT.mc_id=academic-77958-bethanycheum): Join a global community of student ambassadors—your gateway to Microsoft.

# Getting Started

> **Complete Beginners**: New to data science? Begin with our [beginner-friendly examples](examples/README.md)! These simple, well-commented examples will help you grasp the basics before diving into the full curriculum.

> **Teachers**: We've [included suggestions](for-teachers.md) on how to use this curriculum. Share your feedback [in our discussion forum](https://github.com/microsoft/Data-Science-For-Beginners/discussions)!

> **[Students](https://aka.ms/student-page)**: To use this curriculum independently, fork the repository and complete the exercises, starting with the pre-lecture quiz. Then, read the lecture and complete the activities. Try to build the projects by understanding the lessons rather than copying the solution code (available in the /solutions folders for each project-based lesson). Alternatively, form a study group with friends and go through the content together. For further study, explore [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/users/jenlooper-2911/collections/qprpajyoy3x0g7?WT.mc_id=academic-77958-bethanycheum).

## Pedagogy

This curriculum is built on two key principles: project-based learning and frequent quizzes. By the end of this series, students will understand fundamental data science concepts, including ethical considerations, data preparation, data visualization, data analysis, real-world applications, and more.

Low-stakes quizzes before a class help students focus on the topic, while post-class quizzes reinforce retention. The curriculum is designed to be flexible and engaging, allowing students to complete it in full or in part. Projects start small and grow in complexity over the 10-week cycle.

> Check out our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md), and [Translation](TRANSLATIONS.md) guidelines. We welcome your constructive feedback!

## Each lesson includes:

- Optional sketchnote
- Optional supplemental video
- Pre-lesson warmup quiz
- Written lesson
- Step-by-step guides for project-based lessons
- Knowledge checks
- A challenge
- Supplemental reading
- Assignment
- [Post-lesson quiz](https://ff-quizzes.netlify.app/en/)
> **A note about quizzes**: All quizzes are located in the Quiz-App folder, containing a total of 40 quizzes with three questions each. They are linked within the lessons, but the quiz app can be run locally or deployed to Azure; follow the instructions in the `quiz-app` folder. Localization is ongoing.

## 🎓 Beginner-Friendly Examples

**New to Data Science?** We've created a special [examples directory](examples/README.md) with simple, well-commented code to help you get started:

- 🌟 **Hello World** - Your first data science program
- 📂 **Loading Data** - Learn how to read and explore datasets
- 📊 **Simple Analysis** - Calculate statistics and identify patterns
- 📈 **Basic Visualization** - Create charts and graphs
- 🔬 **Real-World Project** - Complete workflow from start to finish

Each example includes detailed comments explaining every step, making it ideal for absolute beginners!

## GitHub Codespaces

Follow these steps to open this sample in a Codespace:
1. Click the Code drop-down menu and select the Open with Codespaces option.
2. Select + New codespace at the bottom of the pane.
For more info, check out the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository#creating-a-codespace).

## VSCode Remote - Containers
Follow these steps to open this repo in a container using your local machine and VSCode with the VS Code Remote - Containers extension:

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please ensure your system meets the prerequisites (i.e., have Docker installed) in [the getting started documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers#_getting-started).

To use this repository, you can either open the repository in an isolated Docker volume:

**Note**: Under the hood, this will use the Remote-Containers: **Clone Repository in Container Volume...** command to clone the source code in a Docker volume instead of the local filesystem. [Volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) are the preferred mechanism for persisting container data.

Or open a locally cloned or downloaded version of the repository:

- Clone this repository to your local filesystem.
- Press F1 and select the **Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...** command.
- Select the cloned copy of this folder, wait for the container to start, and try things out.

## Offline access

You can run this documentation offline by using [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/). Fork this repo, [install Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/quickstart) on your local machine, then in the root folder of this repo, type `docsify serve`. The website will be served on port 3000 on your localhost: `localhost:3000`.

> Note, notebooks will not be rendered via Docsify, so when you need to run a notebook, do that separately in VS Code running a Python kernel.

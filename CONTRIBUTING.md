### Fork and Clone

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Data-Science-For-Beginners.git
   cd Data-Science-For-Beginners
   ```
3. **Add upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/microsoft/Data-Science-For-Beginners.git
   ```

### Create a Branch

Create a new branch for your work:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

Branch naming conventions:
- `feature/` - New features or lessons
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation changes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring

## Contribution Guidelines

### For Lesson Content

When contributing lessons or modifying existing ones:

1. **Follow the existing structure**:
   - README.md with lesson content
   - Jupyter notebook with exercises
   - Assignment (if applicable)
   - Link to pre and post quizzes

2. **Include these elements**:
   - Clear learning objectives
   - Step-by-step explanations
   - Code examples with comments
   - Exercises for practice
   - Links to additional resources

3. **Ensure accessibility**:
   - Use clear, simple language
   - Provide alt text for images
   - Include code comments
   - Consider different learning styles

### For Jupyter Notebooks

1. **Clear all outputs** before committing:
   ```bash
   jupyter nbconvert --clear-output --inplace notebook.ipynb
   ```

2. **Include markdown cells** with explanations

3. **Use consistent formatting**:
   ```python
   # Import libraries at the top
   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   
   # Use meaningful variable names
   # Add comments for complex operations
   # Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
   ```

4. **Test your notebook** completely before submitting

### For Python Code

Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guidelines:

```python
# Good practices
import pandas as pd

def calculate_mean(data):
    """Calculate the mean of a dataset.
    
    Args:
        data (list): List of numerical values
        
    Returns:
        float: Mean of the dataset
    """
    return sum(data) / len(data)
```

### For Quiz App Contributions

When modifying the quiz application:

1. **Test locally**:
   ```bash
   cd quiz-app
   npm install
   npm run serve
   ```

2. **Run linter**:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

3. **Build successfully**:
   ```bash

   ```

4. **Follow Vue.js style guide** and existing patterns

### For Translations

When adding or updating translations:

4. Update quiz links to include language parameter: `?loc=fr`
5. Test all links and formatting

## Pull Request Process
